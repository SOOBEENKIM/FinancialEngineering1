# 📈 Financial Engineering Projects

This repository presents a set of projects that explore core topics in financial engineering through Python-based modeling and analysis. The notebooks are structured around three major problems, each focusing on a different aspect of portfolio theory and asset pricing.

---

## 📘 Project Summary

The main objective is to bridge theoretical finance models with practical implementation. The tasks include:

- Constructing efficient portfolios using Markowitz's mean-variance optimization
- Applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate expected returns and factor sensitivities
- Performing real-data-based portfolio optimization with historical market data

These projects were completed as part of a university-level financial engineering course.

## 📂 Notebook Overview

### 🔹 `Proj1_Problem1.ipynb` – Modern Portfolio Theory

Implements mean-variance portfolio optimization (Markowitz framework).  
Focuses on computing the efficient frontier and identifying optimal portfolios based on risk-return tradeoffs.

### 🔹 `Proj1_Problem2.ipynb` – CAPM & Factor Model

Applies CAPM and multi-factor regression analysis to understand the relationship between asset returns and market risk factors.  
Emphasizes beta estimation and validation of pricing assumptions using financial datasets.

### 🔹 `Additional_Problem3.ipynb` – Real-World Portfolio Optimization

Uses real stock market data (via `yfinance`) to perform practical portfolio optimization.  
Integrates data preprocessing, return calculation, and numerical optimization under constraints.
